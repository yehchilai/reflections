When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	
	It is more convenient to work the same project in different machines or locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	It may affect current working directory.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are copying repositories through GitHub. Clones are copying repositories from local to local or GitHub to local. Branches are making another branch for adding features, developing other versions, testing, or other implementation which does not affect the original program.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	It is good for developer to get the latest software and see the problem sooner.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	It would be harder because it is really diffcult to communicate others without comparing the code and show the difference.
