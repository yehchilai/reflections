When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	
	It is more convenient to work the same project in different machines or locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	It may affect current working directory.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are copying repositories through GitHub. Clones are copying repositories from local to local or GitHub to local. Branches are making another branch for adding features, developing other versions, testing, or other implementation which does not affect the original program.
